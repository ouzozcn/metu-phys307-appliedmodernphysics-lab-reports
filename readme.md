## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the most out of this repository, you'll need a basic understanding of LaTeX. If you're new to it, don’t worry! Here’s how to get started:

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Download a modern TeX distribution package manager like [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).
3. Install a LaTeX editor like [TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/).
4. Open any experiment folder first, then open the `document.tex` file with your TeX editor, and start exploring or customizing it to fit your experiment!
5. If you want to use .PDF files, you can open the `document.pdf` file in the related folder.
